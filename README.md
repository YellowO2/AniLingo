# AniLingo - Immersive Language Learning through Anime Style Character Roleplay

## Industry Pain Points Addressed

Traditional language learning suffers from:

- **Low engagement rates** (60-80% abandonment within 30 days)
- **Poor real-world application** (students memorize but can't converse)
- **One-size-fits-all content** that ignores individual interests
- **Delayed feedback loops** preventing rapid improvement

## Our Solution

AniLingo transforms language learning through interactive roleplaying with AI character tutors that adapt to your interests, provide real-time feedback, and create emotionally engaging experiences.

With the help of Gen AI, it allows us to have:

- **Adaptive conversations** that evolve based on user mistakes
- **Personalized scenarios** tailored to individual interests
- **Contextual corrections** that explain errors within natural dialogue
- **Emotional engagement** through character reactions to progress
